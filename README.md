## Motivation

Endly is comprehensive workflow based automation and end-to-end (E2E) testing tool designed to simulate a production environment as closely as possible. 
This includes the full spectrum of network communications, user interactions, data storage, and other dependencies. 
By doing so, it aims to ensure that systems are thoroughly tested under conditions that mimic real-world operations, 
helping to identify and address potential issues before deployment.

## Introduction

Endly is a highly versatile automation and orchestration platform that provides a wide range of services to support various aspects of software development, 
testing, deployment, and operations. 

Below is a summary of the types of services Endly can orchestrate, grouped by their primary functionality:

### Platform, Infrastructure and Cloud Providers:

- Docker([docker](service/system/docker)): Provides services for managing Docker containers and executing commands over SSH within Docker environments,
  enhancing container management and deployment.
- AWS Services([aws/*](service/system/cloud/aws)): Offers orchestration for numerous AWS services, including API Gateway, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, EC2, IAM,
  Kinesis, KMS, Lambda, RDS, S3, SES, SNS, SQS, and SSM. These services enable management and automation of AWS
  resources, monitoring, notification, and security.
- GCP Services([gcp/*](service/system/cloud/gcp)): Supports Google Cloud Platform resources such as BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, Compute
  Engine, GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), KMS, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, and Cloud Storage. These services are essential for
  managing Google Cloud resources, data analysis, event-driven computing, and storage.

###  Environment/System Management

- Exec([exec](service/system/exec)): This service is central to executing shell commands, allowing for automation of tasks that interact directly
  with the operating system. This capability is essential for setting up environments, running scripts, and performing
  system-level operations, thereby serving as a foundation for environment and system management within Endly's
  orchestration capabilities.
- Process([process](service/system/process)): Manages processes or daemons on the system, enabling control over the lifecycle of various applications or
  services running in the background. This service is key for ensuring that necessary services are operational during
  testing or deployment, and for automating start, stop, and restart operations of system services as part of
  environment setup and maintenance.
- Storage([storage](service/system/storage)): Facilitates the management of file-based assets, including uploading, downloading, and managing files. This
  service is crucial for handling configuration files, test data, and other file-based resources needed throughout the
  automation, testing, and deployment processes. It supports the simulation of real-world environments by ensuring the
  correct setup of file systems and data storage scenarios.
- Secret([secret](service/system/secret)): Manages safe access to secrets, such as passwords and API keys, crucial for maintaining security in automated
  processes.

###  Development and Deployment

- Version control([vc](service/deployment/vc)) service to manage source code.
- SDK([sdk](service/deployment/sdk)) service for setting specific sdk (go/node)

### Database and Data Management

- DSUnit([dsunit](service/testing/dsunit)): Facilitates database testing, supporting the setup and teardown of database states for testing purposes.

### Testing and Integration

- HTTP/REST([http/runner](service/testing/runner/http)): Provides tools for testing and interacting with HTTP endpoints and RESTful APIs. This service is
  instrumental in API testing, allowing for the automation of requests, response validation, and the simulation of
  various API usage scenarios. It supports both the verification of external services and the testing of application
  interfaces, making it a vital component for ensuring the functionality and reliability of web services and
  applications. In addition, runner allows can be used as load testing tool, enabling the simulation of high traffic scenarios to evaluate system
  performance and scalability. This service is essential for assessing the robustness of applications under heavy loads
  and for identifying performance bottlenecks that may arise in production environments.
- HTTP/Endpoint([http/endpoint](service/testing/endpoint/http)): This service extends Endly's capabilities into the realm of HTTP communication testing by allowing
  users to listen to existing HTTP interactions, record them, and subsequently mock these interactions for the purpose
  of testing. This functionality is particularly useful for simulating third-party HTTP integrations without the need
  for the third-party services to be actively involved in the testing process. By capturing and replicating the behavior
  of external HTTP services, it enables developers to conduct thorough testing of application integrations in a
  controlled, predictable environment. This approach ensures that applications can gracefully handle external HTTP
  requests and responses, facilitating the validation of integration points with external APIs and services. The ability
  to mock external HTTP interactions is invaluable for continuous integration and testing workflows, where external
  dependencies must be accurately simulated to verify application functionality and resilience.
- WebDrvier([webdriver](service/testing/runner/webdriver)): Supports browser-based testing and automation, essential for web application testing.
- Validator([validator](service/testing/validator)): Provides validation services, including log validation, to ensure that applications behave as expected.
- Postman ([migration/postman](service/migration/postman)): Service for migrating postman scripts into endly workflow.
- Rest([rest](service/testing/runner/rest)): Service for testing REST API.


Communication and Messaging

- Message Bus([msg](service/testing/msg)): Universal message bus service for testing queue, topic and subscription
- SMTP ([smtp](service/notify/smtp)):  Service for sending emails.
- Slack  ([slack](service/notify/slack)): Services for sending Slack messages, enabling notifications and alerts as part of the
  automation workflows.

Endly is open source project to check the latest list of endly supported service run on terminal:

```endly -s='*'```


## Getting Started


##### Installation
  - [Install/Download](doc/installation)
  - [Endly docker image](docker/)



##### Examples:


**a) Infrastructure/Environment preparation**

For instance: the following define inline workflow to prepare app system services:

@system.yaml
```yaml
tasks: $tasks
defaults:
  target: $serviceTarget
pipeline:
  destroy:
    stop-images:
      action: docker:stop
      images:
        - mysql
        - aerospike
  init:
    services:
      mysql:
        workflow: "service/mysql:start"
        name: mydb3
        version: $mysqlVersion
        credentials: $mysqlCredentials
        config: config/my.cnf
      aerospike:

           ORDER BY 1
```


**f) Testing**

For instance: the following  define inline workflow to run test with selenium runner:


@test.yaml

```yaml
defaults:
  target:
     URL: ssh://127.0.0.1/
     credentials: localhost
pipeline:
  init:
    action: selenium:start
    version: 3.4.0
    port: 8085
    sdk: jdk
    sdkVersion: 1.8
  test:
    action: selenium:run
    browser: firefox
    remoteSelenium:
      URL: http://127.0.0.1:8085
    commands:
      - get(http://play.golang.org/?simple=1)
      - (#code).clear
      - (#code).sendKeys(package main

          import "fmt"

          func main() {
              fmt.Println("Hello Endly!")
          }
        )
      - (#run).click
      - command: output = (#output).text
        exit: $output.Text:/Endly/
        sleepTimeMs: 1000
        repeat: 10
      - close
    expect:
      output:
        Text: /Hello Endly!/
```

```bash
endly -r=test
```


**g) Stress testing:**

The following  define inline workflow that loads request and desired responses from data folder for stress testing.

@load.yaml
```yaml
init:
  testEndpoint: z.myendoint.com
pipeline:
  test:
    tag: StressTest
    data:
      []Requests: '@data/*request.json'
      []Responses: '@data/*response.json'
    range: '1..1'
    template:
      info:
        action: print
        message: starting load testing 
      load:
        action: 'http/runner:load'
        threadCount: 3
        '@repeat': 100
        requests: $data.Requests
        expect:
          Responses: $data.Responses
      load-info:
        action: print
        message: 'QPS: $load.QPS: Response: min: $load.MinResponseTimeInMs ms, avg: $load.AvgResponseTimeInMs ms max: $load.MaxResponseTimeInMs ms'

```

Where data folder contains http request and desired responses i.e 

@data/XXX_request.json
```json
{
  "Method":"get",
  "URL":"http://${testEndpoint}/bg/?pixid=123"
}
```

@data/XXX_response.json
```json
{
  "Code":200,
  "Body":"/some expected fragement/"
}
```


```bash
endly -r=load
```



**h) Serverless e2e testing with cloud function**


@test.yaml
